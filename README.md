# Assignment 5 - Machine Learning in R

### Author: Maria Spaeth
### Submission date: 07/22/2025
### Environment: see environment.yml file 
### Description:
This is for BSGP7030 where we look at how to use do machine learning in R. We followed the "Your First Machine Learning Project in R Step-by-Step" tutorial by Jason Brownlee. In this tutorial we learned how to install R packages, load datasets to R, and how to summarize the dataset with statistics and visualization. We also learned how to evaluate different algorithms for machine learning. To do this we split our dataset (iris.csv) into teaching and testing groups. We then made some predictions with the algorithm that we determined was the best for our uses.
